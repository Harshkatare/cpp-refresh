# C++ Revision

This repository contains my personal revision of the C++ programming language. I'm revisiting core concepts, syntax, and problem-solving using C++. Each folder or file is focused on a specific topic or concept.

## Structure

- `basics/` - Basic syntax, variables, data types, operators
- `control-flow/` - if-else, loops, switch
- `functions/` - Function declarations, recursion, inline functions
- `oop/` - Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
- `stl/` - Standard Template Library usage (vectors, maps, etc.)
- `practice/` - Practice problems and solutions

## Purpose

- To revise and reinforce C++ concepts
- To have remote access to my revision work
- To keep my progress organized and versioned
    
## How to Use

You can browse through the folders to see examples and code snippets. Each file is self-contained and focused on one concept.
